He trembled and cried. \nthen they said something that lessened his cries. \nThat was my first time watching the humans. \nThe humans then danced to a fireplace, \nate cooked meat from the animal that they killed while interacting with others, \nand hugged each other in a room where there are only two of them. \nI did not get why they do this and I still don't. \nThis is the first time I had seen something so unfamiliar since the world had been existing. \nIt confuses me. \nI thought following them for longer would give me the answer."
