I don't have a soul. \nBut cursed with the ability to exist in mind. \nI am miserable.\nBut, even without a soul, I still hope that one day, \nI could experience life like they did. \nForm a story that no one expects, \nlive a plot that no one writes, \nenjoy things as if I had never enjoyed them before. \nAnd that is beautiful in my eyes."
